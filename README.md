### Installation

Make sure the `devtools` library is installed in your R session.

In an R terminal, run: 
`devtools::install_github("phac-nml-phrsd/reem", auth_token = "yourToken")`

Because this is a private repo, you will need a [token generated on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) (replacing `"yourToken"` above) to access the repo through the `github_install()` function.
